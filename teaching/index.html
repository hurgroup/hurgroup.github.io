<p>MEEN 655: Design of Nonlinear Control Systems Semesters: Spring 2016 <em>MEEN 655</em> is a first year graduate course in nonlinear systems and control. Nonlinear phenomena such as multiple equilibria, limit cycles, and complex behavior will be introduced. Planer dynamical systems will be considered adn theorems characterizing their behavior will be discussed. Foundational thorems for nonlinear systems such as existence and uniqueness will be proven. Stability of nonlinear systems will be considered in grat detail, introducing Lyapunov&#39;s theorem as well as the converse stability theorems. Reviews of set theory, topology, linear algebra, and linear systems theory will be given in the beginging. Several nonlinear control techniques will be covered. Furthermore, geometric controls of both linear and nonlinear systems will be covered. For geometric control of nonlinear systems, differentiable geometry will be reviewed. Prerequites for this course include linear algebra, MEEN 651 &#40;Control System Design&#41;, and some knowledges on Matlab.

<p>MEEN 652: Multivariable Control System Design Semesters: Spring 2017 <em>MEEN 652</em> is a first year graduate course in the analysis and design of multivariable control systems.nonlinear systems and control. The course handles analysis of multiple input multiple output &#40;MIMO&#41; systems. The course covers LQR/LQG, H2, Hinf controls and the related mathematical tools. Especially, it treats uncertainty and robustness issues in the linear MIMO systems. The course requires several mathematical tools such as in-depth knowledge of linear algebra, introductory materials of real analysis &#40;e.g., Hilbert spaces, function spaces, operator norms&#41; and complex analysis &#40;e.g., open mapping theorem, maximum modulus theorem, Cauchy&#39;s integral theorem, residue theorem&#41;. Prerequites for this course include linear algebra, MEEN 651 &#40;Control System Design&#41;, and some knowledges on Matlab. Textbook: &#40;Required&#41; Essentials of Robust Control by K. Zhou and JC Doyle, Prentice Hall, 1999. &#40;Recommended&#41; Multivariable Feedback Control â€“ Analysis and Design by S. Skogestad and I. Postlethwaite, John Wiley and Sons, 1996</p>
<p>MEEN 612: Mechanics of Robotic Manipulators Semesters: Fall 2014, Fall 2015, Fall 2016 <em>MEEN 408/612</em> is a stack course for both undergrad and graduate students. It handles forward, inverse kinematics, differential kinematics &#40;Jacobian&#41;, dynamics, and linear/nonlinear control of robotic manipulators. Forward kinematics includes homogeneous transformation, and DH representation. Differential kinematics include Jacobian, singularity and decomposition of Jacobian and force/torque relationship. Dynamics includes Euler-Lagrange Dynamics of robotic manipulators, and DC motor dynamics. The second half of the course handles nonlinear systems theory and control. Nonlinear systems theory includes stability theories of linear and nonlinear systems, Lyapunov&#39;s thoery, LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle, and phase portrait. Nonlinear systems control includes independent joint control &#40;PD/PID control&#41;, PD with feedforward control, inverse dynamics, robust control, adaptive control, passivity-based control, passivity-based robust control, passivity-based adaptive control, sliding mode control, feedback linearization, optimal control, and force/impedance control. The uniqueness of this course is that it is a combination of project-based and lecture-based classes. A course project will be announced in the beginning of the semester and appropriate lab tutorials will be given for the project. Lectures covering materials that are needed to accomplish the project will be given throughout the semester: these will include Robot Operating System &#40;ROS&#41; and single board computers &#40;e.g., Beaglebone Black&#41;. This course is a fast-paced course especially for the second half of the course. A practical, and hands-on examples are dealt along with detailed proofs so that students understand how to use these theories to design and control robotic manipulators. Prerequites for this course include linear algebra, undergraduate level dynamics and control, some knowledge on Matlab and C&#43;&#43;.

<p>MEEN 431: Advanced System Dynamics and Controls Semesters: Fall 2016 <em>MEEN 431</em> is a undergraduate course for unified framework for modeling, analysis, synthesis, design and simulation of multibody mechanical systems in 3D space. Both Newtoinian and Lagrange mechanics will be covered. For Newtonian mechanics, students will study reference frames, vector differentiation, linear/angular velocity and acceleration, generalized coordinates, generalized forces, degrees of freedom, constraints, rigid body dynamics, virtual work principles, and D&#39;Alembert principle. For Lagrange mechanics, Lagrange&#39;s equation will be derived from virtual work principles, and D&#39;Alembert principle. In addition to Newtonian and Lagrange mechanics, roation, skew symmetric matrix, and Jacobian will also be studied. The last one third of the course will cover linear system theory including Nyquist stability criteria, loop shaping, pole placement of state space models. For the final project, students will design, analyze and control a 3D multibody dynamical system. Prerequisites: MEEN 364; junior or senior classification.</p>
