 <a href="/teaching/robust_control_spring2024">&#91;detailed information&#93;</a><br />Semesters: Spring 2024<br /><em>ME8102</em>, grounded in the principles outlined in the &quot;Essentials of Robust Control&quot; textbook, embarks on an in-depth exploration of robust \( H_{\infty} \) and control theory, tailored for systems encountering multiple sources of uncertainties, noises, and disturbances. Beginning with a foundational overview of linear systems and basic linear algebra, the course progressively delves into advanced topics including the intricacies of \( H_{2} \) and \( H_{\infty} \) spaces &#40;Hardy spaces&#41;, and the critical roles they play in control system analysis and design. Through a structured journey from the basics of system theoretical concepts to the complexities of controller synthesis and performance evaluation, students will engage with both theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies. The course aims to equip students with the knowledge and tools to analyze and design controllers that ensure desired performance and robustness in the face of system uncertainties, laying a solid foundation for advanced studies in control theory.</p>

  <summary>MEEN 612: Mechanics of Robotic Manipulators</summary>
 Semesters: Fall 2014, Fall 2015, Fall 2016<br /><em>MEEN 408/612</em> is a stack course for both undergrad and graduate students. It handles forward, inverse kinematics, differential kinematics &#40;Jacobian&#41;, dynamics, and linear/nonlinear control of robotic manipulators. Forward kinematics includes homogeneous transformation, and DH representation. Differential kinematics include Jacobian, singularity and decomposition of Jacobian and force/torque relationship. Dynamics includes Euler-Lagrange Dynamics of robotic manipulators, and DC motor dynamics. The second half of the course handles nonlinear systems theory and control. Nonlinear systems theory includes stability theories of linear and nonlinear systems, Lyapunov&#39;s thoery, LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle, and phase portrait. Nonlinear systems control includes independent joint control &#40;PD/PID control&#41;, PD with feedforward control, inverse dynamics, robust control, adaptive control, passivity-based control, passivity-based robust control, passivity-based adaptive control, sliding mode control, feedback linearization, optimal control, and force/impedance control. The uniqueness of this course is that it is a combination of project-based and lecture-based classes. A course project will be announced in the beginning of the semester and appropriate lab tutorials will be given for the project. Lectures covering materials that are needed to accomplish the project will be given throughout the semester: these will include Robot Operating System &#40;ROS&#41; and single board computers &#40;e.g., Beaglebone Black&#41;. This course is a fast-paced course especially for the second half of the course. A practical, and hands-on examples are dealt along with detailed proofs so that students understand how to use these theories to design and control robotic manipulators. Prerequites for this course include linear algebra, undergraduate level dynamics and control, some knowledge on Matlab and C&#43;&#43;.</p>

  <summary>MEEN 431: Advanced System Dynamics and Controls</summary>
 Semesters: Fall 2016<br /><em>MEEN 431</em> is a undergraduate course for unified framework for modeling, analysis, synthesis, design and simulation of multibody mechanical systems in 3D space. Both Newtoinian and Lagrange mechanics will be covered. For Newtonian mechanics, students will study reference frames, vector differentiation, linear/angular velocity and acceleration, generalized coordinates, generalized forces, degrees of freedom, constraints, rigid body dynamics, virtual work principles, and D&#39;Alembert principle. For Lagrange mechanics, Lagrange&#39;s equation will be derived from virtual work principles, and D&#39;Alembert principle. In addition to Newtonian and Lagrange mechanics, roation, skew symmetric matrix, and Jacobian will also be studied. The last one third of the course will cover linear system theory including Nyquist stability criteria, loop shaping, pole placement of state space models. For the final project, students will design, analyze and control a 3D multibody dynamical system. </p>

  <summary>MEEN 357: Engineering Analysis for Mechanical Engineers</summary>
 Semesters: Spring 2019, Summer 2019, Summer 2020, Fall 2020<br /><em>MEEN 357</em> provides a practical foundation for the use of numerical methods to solve engineering problems. The topics studied in this course are: solving systems of linear equations, curve fitting and root finding, numerical integration and differentiation, initial value and two-point boundary value problems, plus eigenvalues and optimization methods. We will study these techniques mathematically, develop numerical approximations for them, and apply them to solve engineering problems. Personal computers are used extensively in this course. Students are required to program these numerical analysis techniques, many will be programmed from scratch, even if there exists an implementation in the extensive Python standard library: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html</a> or in the numerous third-party libraries, for example: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules</a>.<br /><em>Python</em> the programming language that we will use in this class. It is the fastest growing programming language in the World today, and as of this year, is being taught in freshman engineering. Spyder is the IDE that will be used, and it is installed on the computers in the MEEN Computer Lab. No previous knowledge of programming, in general, or of Python, in particular, is required. Nevertheless, students are expected to become proficient in the use of this tool by the end of the semester. This typically requires a great deal of self-learning on the student&#39;s part, which is why self-help tutorials are so important.</p>
