<p>This project aims to develop a controller to control the powered lower knee exoskeleton using FEP theory &#40;Free energy principle&#41;. FEP is the theory that unifies motor control/perception/learning by minimizing the free energy. The FEP has several advantages over existing methods. In the case of perception, FEP reduces the effect of noise or delays only considering free energy that depends on observed variables and prior about noise. This allows the system to estimate hidden states or filter noise with asmall delay. In addition, FEP needs a small amount of time compared to conventional optimization methods for generating control input and doesn’t need any trained complex learning model &#40;CNN, RNN, etc&#41; to adapt to the environment in which the agent exists. We are trying to apply the FEP to a knee exoskeleton controller to utilize these advantages. In further research, we will apply an FEP-based controller to various cases.

<p>Our group is leading a project aimed at developing an AI-based ground walking exoskeleton robot for hemiplegic walking rehabilitation. Our primary role is the development of control technology for the effective operation of this innovative exoskeleton. In this project, we are conducting technical research on data mapping with and without the use of a walker, trajectory tracking control based on gait data, and compliance control for rehabilitation of the affected and normal sides of gait. The goal of this project is to develop a controller optimized for the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients, positively impacting their lives.</p>

<p>This research focuses on developing a module that utilizes advanced data analysis and artificial intelligence-based machine learning to analyze the movements of recurve archer using IMU data and their shooting outcomes. The goal is to provide valuable insights that can enhance athletes&#39; performance by leveraging this analysis. The module serves as a key component of an integrated platform, which facilitates systematic management and scientific evaluation of athletes&#39; training and competition records. Moreover, it includes the validation of the accuracy and reliability of video data based on IMU sensor data to ensure effectiveness of the analysis.

<p><strong>Funding Agent: LG Electronics</strong></p>
<p>This project addresses the issue of robot vacuum cleaners getting stuck on furniture, interior elements, and other obstacles such as tables and chairs during operation. The primary cause of this problem is that obstacles at certain heights do not get detected by the robot&#39;s sensors, including lidar, bumper sensors, and laser sensors. The robot perceives these as flat surfaces, leading to collisions and the robot forcibly pushing against these obstacles.<br/> To resolve this, the project proposes the integration of a new path planning approach along with the Free Energy Principle &#40;FEP&#41;. This strategy aims to prevent the vacuum cleaner from forcefully entering areas blocked by furniture or window frames, thus reducing the risk of getting stuck and minimizing damage to the furniture. By accurately estimating the likelihood of entanglement before it occurs, the robot can generate and control its path in a way that avoids these obstacles effectively.</p>

<p>This project seeks to develop a diagnostic model for foot and ankle disorders by linking anatomical features with gait patterns, using a blend of medical imaging and gait data, including a significant dataset from AI Hub&#39;s &quot;Gait Video Data for Foot Disorders and Rehabilitation Progress Evaluation.&quot; It employs statistical methods and machine learning to analyze the anatomical structures and gait characteristics of foot and ankle patients. The goal is to identify patterns that can lead to rapid and precise diagnoses by exploring the variance in anatomical structures across different disorders. The comprehensive dataset facilitates a detailed examination of foot and ankle anatomy and movement, aiming to overcome previous research limitations related to small sample sizes. Through advanced preprocessing and the application of statistical shape models to X-ray data, the project visualizes bone shapes and orientations, offering an intuitive understanding of disorder-specific differences. The diagnostic model leverages various machine learning techniques to isolate significant variables for disease classification, enhancing clinical insights into foot and ankle disorders.
